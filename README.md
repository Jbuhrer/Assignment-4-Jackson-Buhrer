Here are the steps on how to run my file:
1. First open up my code in your preferred terminal. Make sure it has access to python.
2. Then, save the code on your computer and run the controller with the command python sdn_controller.py
3. You will see a lost of commands that will pop up that will allow you to interact with the controller. Such as add_node, remove_node, add_link, remove_link, inject_flow, show_flows, query, visualize, etc. 
Play around with it and let me know if there are any problems.
